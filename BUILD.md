## Building Wt from source

Building instructions can be found for:
 - [Unix](https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/doc/reference/html/InstallationUnix.html)
 - [Windows](https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/doc/reference/html/InstallationWindows.html)

 Generally speaking Windows users will be using prebuilt binaries, found [here](https://github.com/emweb/wt/releases).
 The installation manual still goes over the building process, and all its options. The Windows binaries are built using all
 possible dependencies on Windows, so that all functionality is included.

 Currently the Windows building section, found on [Redmine](https://redmine.emweb.be/projects/wt/wiki/Installing_Wt_on_MS_Windows)
 is severely outdated, and should be read with a grain of salt. Any mention of minimal versions is completely wrong, the ones mentioned
 in the documentation is correct.
